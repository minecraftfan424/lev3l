## Configuration
**Note: Do not share your bot token publicly!**

You need to rename `config.json.example` file to `config.json` and after you done that, you need to specify your bot token, your user id, and prefix.

```json
{
    "token": "yourbottoken",
    "ownerID": "youruserid",
    "prefix": "yourprefix"
}
```

## Important!
> Your bot requires these permissions: 
1. ATTACH_FILES (So that your bot will be able to send your rank card)
2. SEND_MESSAGES (very important)
3. MESSAGE_EMBED or EMBED_LINKS (So that your bot will be able to send an embed message)
4. MANAGE_ROLES (This is very important if you want to add leveling roles to your bot.)
